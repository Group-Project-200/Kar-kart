When taking the code:
- Use state.py as the main file
- for examples on how to implement check the other files in main
- there are two different implementations please use the one with classes and oop
- Please when you are pushing to your branch, do **git push --force origin your_branch_name** so you will overwrite the current files 

Rules for repo:
- please use your own branch depending on your task
- If you want to create extra branches do so but name them appropriately
- We will all merge our codes together
- for each screen please creat a seperate file
